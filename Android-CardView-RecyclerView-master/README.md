# Android-CardView-RecyclerView-Practice

We'll design this type of sample Android App.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasancse91/Android-CardView-RecyclerView/master/Related_Data/app_screenshot.png" width="250" height="444" />

Upper portion contains a Horizontal Scroller. Lower portion contains a vertical scroller. Both are created with RecyclerView.

All data will come from [this API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasancse91/Android-CardView-RecyclerView/master/Related_Data/data.json) in JSON format.

I used here:
- CardVeiw
- RecyclerView
- Retrofit for network call
- Picasso for image loading
